This directory (AT/RAM if installed correctly) contains the most recent
version of the RAM PE (Parabolic Equation) acoustic propagation model
written by Michael Collins of NRL, with some minor modifications by HLS.
A short summary of the modifications can be found in the file named
"diffs_re_nrl.txt". The original, unmodified code was obtained from
the NRL ftp server at;

	ftp://ftp.ccs.nrl.navy.mil/pub/ram/RAM/

Because RAM is not an integral part of the HLS Acoustics Toolbox,
building it is a separate task. There is a single FORTRAN source file
named "ram.f" that needs to be compiled to produce an executable file
"ram.exe" which should then be copied into the ../bin directory. This
can be done manually as shown below or if you have a make utility
by using the provided Makefile

	gfortran -o ram.exe -Os ram.f

	copy ram.exe ..\bin

If you use the provided Makefile, it will likely require customization 
to reflect which FORTRAN compiler you have. Edit the Makefile, and
modify the assignment to FC to reflect your FORTRAN compiler (the full
path to the compiler may be required depending on how it was installed).
The FFLAGS variable may also need to be modified to specify the compiler
flags for the desired level of optimization which is compiler dependent
in general. For g77 or gfortran, either -Os or -O2 work well.
